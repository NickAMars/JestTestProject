Task with setting up a jest test for backend and front end applications to be run and view by professor..

Had a warning telling me to work with typescript version 5.0.0 > when i am using ts-jest package

**SETTING UP TEST ERROR**
### decrease version to 4.8.4
<sub>ts-jest[versions] (WARN) Version 5.0.2 of typescript installed has not been tested with ts-jest. If you're experiencing issues, consider using a supported version (>=4.3.0 < 5.0.0 0). Please do not report issues in ts-jest if you are using unsupported versions.</sub>
 
### adding typescript config file (tsconfig.json)
<sub>ts-jest[config] (WARN) message TS151001: If you have issues related to imports, you should consider setting `esModuleInterop` to `true` in your TypeScript configuration file (usually `tsconfig.json`).
